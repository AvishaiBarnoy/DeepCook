# Dinner Generator
Dinner Generator is a Python program that randomly suggests ideas to prepare for dinner.

# Description
< one day, here you, brave reader, will find a thorough and in-depth description of this project >

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
Python3.6 was used for development, I believe that any Python3 version will be compatible.\n
Pandas==1.4.0

## Installing
If all dependencies are installed you should not have any problem.

## Executing Program
Currently there is no working "main" function, but one will be implemented to run with command line arguments.\n
To generate a random meal idea run:
```
python main.py
```
In the future there will be more options except the single random meal generator.

## Help
There are no known issues, but the program is not really in any mature phase.
