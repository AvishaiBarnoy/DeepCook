list of functions:
1. choose_random
2. filter_long
3. cook_the_dish 
4. reboot_time_stamp - obsolete, should work with logs
5. filter_kosher 
6. read_file

functions should work like this:
1. read_file
2. main function has flags
3. according to flags use filter functions
4. filtered data goes through choose_random
5. will you make this meal, with call is outside choose_random
6. store in different logs -> 1 log for yes, 1 log for no -> statistics

TO DO:
1. write read_file function -> probably already in io_data
2. make list of filtering options
3. write function for each filter
4. make choose_random as thin as possible
5. make log function for both
