# To Do:
1. Remove "break" option as this happens automatically when someones enters an invalid value.
2. look at recipe book for more ideas and add them
3. implement TA flag for choose_random
4. find better way to choose a random meal
5. build a generic function to work with a subgroup of meals

# Things to Add to functions:

## Data organization:
	1. add time_stamp column for better choice making, maybe keep timestamp as a list for statistics?
	2. Do not remove times_made so statistics can be made
	3. implement many timestamps tracking - maybe add a meal creation logfile where timestamps can be stored

## Random choice:
	build a linear function for weights calculations, flags should be specified which weights to add
		with default settings: last_made timestamp, rank, no TA

	1. Adjust weights according to times made - maybe timestamp and then weight adjustment
			is only made if meal was prepared in the last n days.
    2. Adjust weights by ease
    3. Give k-choices ordered by ease and/or rank
    4. make choice by kosher type

## Choose TA:
	1. random choice
	2. choice by type
